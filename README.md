Milton Neo’s FED Project: Frank Ocean’s Musician Webpage

This project is dedicated to celebrating the artistry of Frank Ocean by creating a website that captures and showcases his unique creative essence. Frank Ocean is an artist who writes about love, life and grief with a very specific moody and reflective style that can be difficult to understand at first. By creating this website, I hope to be able to share his artistry with the world more readily by providing a website that introduces user’s to his aesthetic and his art. Through a sleek and modern interface, the site immerses users in the pensive and melancholic style that defines his music and persona. By blending aesthetics, music, and insightful content, the website invites users to delve deeper into who Frank Ocean is, exploring the stories, emotions, and inspiration behind his work. Overall, it aims to give the user a precursory dive into his art. 

The goal of this project is to inspire curiosity and appreciation for Frank Ocean’s artistry. Whether users are longtime fans or newcomers, the website offers an engaging experience designed to resonate with his introspective and innovative style. I aim to share specially curated visuals, fun interactive elements and his immersive soundscapes, hoping each element of the site evokes the intrigue and emotional depth synonymous with Frank Ocean, encouraging users to discover or reconnect with his music on a deeper level. 


My Design Process
As mentioned above, the focal point of the project is to convey Frank Ocean’s enigmatic, complex style of art. I hence focus my design process on two distinct audiences: newcomers and long-time fans. I placed emphasis on the flow of the website, starting with content that is easy to grasp, slowly bringing in more content to ease users into understanding Frank Ocean. 

For newcomers, I want to make it easy for them to understand his career trajectory. Hence, at the front of my website I placed easy-to-read introductory elements such as a biography and his career accomplishments. On the ‘Music’ page is where I introduce them to his music starting from his earliest to his latest work, which is accompanied by explanations of his music and what they mean, which are also followed by tracklisting. Lastly, on the ‘Fanzone’ page, I offer fun interactive elements for newcomers to play around with and fully immerse themselves in his artistry. 

For long-time fans, I placed emphasis on making the elements recognisable and relatable. For example, many fans describe Frank Ocean as ‘Your favorite artist’s favorite artist’. As such, I used that as the header of the biography. Additionally, I understand the importance the fans place on the aesthetics of his album covers; many of them have said that they were drawn to the album art and the colors that he used. Hence, on the music page, I ensure that the album arts are visually appealing, include attractive effects and are easy to see.
